Privacy Policy for Forge Effective date: 2026-02-02

Introduction This Privacy Policy describes how droter (the "Owner", "we", "us") collects, uses, and shares information when you use the [App Name] (the "App"). The App is a personal tool used by the Owner to list and manage ads on Pinterest. This App is intended for use by the Owner only.

Data Controller Data controller: droter Contact email: hello@credentum.ai

Information We Collect Because this App is used only by the Owner, the App collects only the minimum data necessary to access and perform actions on the Owner’s Pinterest account and to operate the App:

Pinterest account data: Pinterest user ID and OAuth access token (required to call the Pinterest API).
Ad content and metadata: Titles, descriptions, images, links, board IDs, and other metadata for ads or Pins that you create or schedule via the App.
Log and diagnostic data: Server logs, error reports, and usage metadata (timestamps, IP addresses, user agent strings) generated while the App runs or is hosted.
Optional: If you provide a contact email, name, or other profile information to the App for administrative purposes, we will store that information.
We do NOT collect personal data from other Pinterest users via the App, except for any public metadata you choose to include when creating Pins or ads.

How We Use Your Information We use the data we collect for the following purposes:
To authenticate with Pinterest and perform API actions (create, update, or delete Pins/ads).
To store and present the ad content and scheduling information you provide.
To log activity, diagnose issues, and maintain and improve the App.
To respond to inquiries or requests made to the contact email.
Legal Basis (where applicable) If you are in a jurisdiction that requires a legal basis for processing (for example, the EU under GDPR), our legal basis for processing your data is:
Performance of a contract: to provide the App’s functionality and act on instructions to create or manage Pins/ads.
Legitimate interests: for logging, security, and to maintain the service.
Storage and Security
Access tokens and other credentials: We store the Pinterest OAuth access token required to access the Owner’s Pinterest account. You should ensure these tokens are stored securely (e.g., encrypted at rest) and access to them is restricted. If the App is hosted, the hosting provider may also have access to server-stored data.
Logs and backups: Log files and backups may contain limited personal data (such as IP addresses). These are retained for troubleshooting and security, as described in Section 8.
Security measures: We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect data against unauthorized access and accidental loss. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. By using the App, you acknowledge this residual risk.
Sharing and Disclosure We do not sell personal data. We may share information with:
Pinterest: To perform API actions, we transmit the access token and request data to Pinterest’s API in accordance with their developer policies.
Service providers: Third-party providers that host the App, provide backups, analytics, or other operational services. These providers process data only as described in this policy and under contract.
Legal requirements: If required by law, subpoena, or similar legal process, we may disclose information to comply with legal obligations.
Data Retention
Access tokens and app data: Stored until you remove the App’s access to your Pinterest account, you delete the App data, or the Owner deletes the data.
Logs: Retained for up to 12 months for troubleshooting and security purposes, unless otherwise required by law. If you want data deleted earlier, contact the Owner at the email above.
Your Rights Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights regarding your personal data, including:
Right to access the personal data we hold about you.
Right to rectify inaccurate personal data.
Right to request deletion of personal data.
Right to restrict or object to processing, and right to data portability. To exercise any of these rights, contact the Owner at the contact email. We may need to verify your identity before acting on requests.
International Transfers Data processed by or on behalf of this App may be transferred to and stored on servers located in countries other than your country. If you are in the EU/EEA or other jurisdiction with data transfer rules, by using the App you consent to such transfers. We take measures to ensure an adequate level of protection for transferred data.

Children’s Privacy The App is not directed to children under the age of 13 (or higher age where local law applies). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe we have collected data from a child, contact us and we will promptly delete that data.

Changes to This Privacy Policy We may update this Policy occasionally. When we do, we will post the revised policy with a new effective date. Significant changes will be communicated via the contact email or through the App.
